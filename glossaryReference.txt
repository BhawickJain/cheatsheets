# Glossary of Terms

property : a token sibling to another token. e.g. `log` is a property of `console`
property access : properties are accessed with [dot] `.`
array access : array is acessed via `[i]`, where i is a integer index.
block : lines that share the same indentation or parent token
expression : a statement that needs to be evaluated into a literal
literal : a value representable in a primitive data type.
evaluate : is to compute an expression into a literal value
string literal : a value of string type, e.g. "a word"
method : a `call`able property
function call : indicated by parentheses `(...)`, invokes a function with an argument list.
argument : literal values passed to a function during invocation.
argument list : literal values delimited by ',', e.g. 1, 2 in add(1, 2)
HTML element : `<div ...>...</div>` including attributes and literal inside
HTML tag : In `<div ...>...</div>`, a `div` tag is used
HTML attribute : In `<div class="note" ...>...</div>`, `class` is an attribute
DOM node property : attribute reflecting an HTML element, returns current value
node : a DOM object node, created when an HTML element is parsed
DOM : Document Object Model, tree of nodes, output of a parsed HTML document
for of loop : `for (let el of elements) {...}`
reference : a pointer to a location
object reference : a reference to an object, typically in memory
object literal : literal representation of object, e.g. JSON
react component function : PascalCased function that returns a single JSX.Element
JSX : extends JS and TS to manipulate DOM nodes like HTML elements
JSX fragment : `<>...</>` or `<>...<>` to group into single JSX.Element without `div`
string interpolation expression : string literal with inline variable substitutions
global execution function :
local execution function :
variable environment :
call stack : a stack to track function calls
stack : a data structure where elements are `push`ed in and `pop`ped out. FIFO-style.
FIFO : first-in-first-out
token : a human readable word used in a computer language to refer to things
array variable : a token which holds a reference to an array object
array : an object in which elements are only accessed by an index
enum : an object where properties can be accessed via an index
object : a data structure of key of string literals and value of a literal or reference.
snake-case : used for `class` html attribute names
camelCase : used for variable and standard function names
PascalCase : used for custom types, interfaces, react component functions names
lowercase : intrinsc JSX.Element and HTML element tags.
function invocation : see function call
css box model : margin-outline-border-padding-content
css utility class : assign a single CSS property by a class attribute value in an element
dynamic typing : type can be reassigned during run-time
static typing : type of a variable is immutable at all times, including run-time
structural typing : types are matches and represented by their structure of primitive type
strong typing : type coercion not allowed when expect type does not match literal's type
weak typing : type coercion allowed if types do not match during invokation or assignment
duck typing : object is considered valid if property access is valid, regardless of its type
type inference : by means a language evaluates the type of an expression
union : properties that are common
garbage collector : a process that frees memory marked as no longer needed
polish notation: the operator preceeds the arguments (e.g. +22 <=> 2+2)
hungarian notation: variable / function name contains its kind or type
